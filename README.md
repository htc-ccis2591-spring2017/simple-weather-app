#Simple Weather Application

This application uses the [Open Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to display current weather data for a city.

To use this application you must have a key for the API that you will enter when prompted.  Once entered, this key will be stored in your browser for later use.

## Assignment Goals:

- Build a JavaScript application object.
- Learn to use an online JSON data web API.
- Use jQuery to get ajax data and show appropriate error messages if the data cannot be obtained.
- Use jQuery to dynamically add the data to the web page.
- Use Aria attributes in HTML to indicate dynamic data


## GitHub Repository
https://github.com/htc-ccis2591/simple-weather-app/

You’ll want to begin each assignment by forking the repository and cloning it locally.  When you are done, you’ll push to GitHub and submit a pull request.

## Web API
For this assignment, we will use the Open Weather API to make a simple JavaScript application to get the weather by zip code.  

### Get API Key
To work with the API, you must register and get an API key.  You can get a free key that is able to make a limited number of requests for data.

### Get Weather by Zip Code
Make a call to get the weather by zip code:  http://openweathermap.org/current#zip

Build HTML to display the weather description (for example, “Sky is clear.”) and the current temperature. Make sure to display the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  You can optionally set up Celcius if you like, but it should not be shown as the default.
